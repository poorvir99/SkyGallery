Opacarophile, Astrophile, Nephophile, and Selenophile are the terms for each of them.

        An opacarophile is a lover of sunsets. It is composed of "opacare" which is Latin for sunset (or dusk), and 'phile' which is Greek for love. Didn't know there was a word for we lovers of setting suns. I'm definitely one of them.
